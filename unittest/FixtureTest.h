/*
	FixtureTest - Includes a basic Fixture-Example to showcase its usability and use it for unittesting

	This file was created as part of my Bachelorthesis to demonstrate the integration of a basic Google-Test Fixture inside an application.
	It contains a basic Example-Fixture from Google-Test.
	Due to the fact that this Applications use-case is to only demonstrate the integration into the CICD-Pipeline, the characteristics of the Fixture will only be basic.
