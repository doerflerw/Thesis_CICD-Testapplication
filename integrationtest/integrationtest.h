/*
	Integrationtests - Basic Fixture

	This file was created as part of my Bachelorthesis to demonstrate the integration of a Fixture for testing purposes inside an application.
	It contains a basic Fixture which is used for Integrationtests.
	This Applications use-case is to only demonstrate the integration into the CICD-Pipeline.
